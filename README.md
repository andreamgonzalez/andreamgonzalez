## Demo Projects ...
* <p><a href="https://andreamgonzalez.github.io/NuCampSite-Site/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Nucamp</a> I built this website for a demo camping site. In this website a customer can purchase and reserve their stay at their chosen camping designation. They also have the capability of logging in to access their purchased goods. This website was built using Bootstrap and Jquery. I recreated the same UI with React and built an app version for android devices using the Android SDK tool and ReactNative. Redux was used for state management.

* <p><a href="https://andreamgonzalez.github.io/JournalFit-Site/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JournalFit</a> I created this demo website for a boutique fitness blog business. This websites interface was built from scratch using HTML | CSS | Bootstrap. The user has the ability to enter their biometric data in order to begin their journal for their fitness journey. This website also runs a blogging business to help its users on their fitness journey. Progress can be accessed by the users through loging in to their account.
